# **LiteLLM: A Deep Dive into the LLM Gateway**

LiteLLM is an open-source Python library that simplifies interacting with and managing Large Language Models (LLMs). It acts as a universal interface, allowing developers to connect to various LLM providers using a standardized format. This means you can switch between different LLMs, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (Gemini), and others, without rewriting your code for each provider's specific API. LiteLLM also offers features like load balancing, caching, and monitoring to optimize performance and cost.

## **Official Website and GitHub Repository**

The official website for LiteLLM is([https://www.litellm.ai/](https://www.litellm.ai/)) 1, providing an overview of LiteLLM's features, pricing, and documentation. You can also find links to the LiteLLM Python SDK and the LiteLLM Gateway (Proxy) Docs. The GitHub repository for LiteLLM is located at [https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) 2. This repository contains the source code for the LiteLLM library, documentation, examples, and a list of supported LLM providers.

## **LiteLLM Features**

LiteLLM offers a range of features that make it a powerful tool for developers working with LLMs:

* **Unified API:** LiteLLM provides a single, OpenAI-style API for interacting with multiple LLM providers 4. This simplifies development by eliminating the need to learn different APIs for each provider. It also handles provider-specific formats (system prompts, context limits) while maintaining the OpenAI syntax 4. This is a key advantage as it allows developers to use a familiar syntax while leveraging the unique capabilities of different LLMs.
* **Wide Model Support:** LiteLLM supports a wide range of LLM providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (Gemini), Azure OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, and more 4. This allows developers to choose the best model for their specific needs. Here's a list of the supported LLMs:

## **Using LiteLLM**

LiteLLM can be used through its Python SDK or its Proxy Server.
**Python SDK:** The Python SDK is ideal for developers who want to integrate LiteLLM directly into their Python code 1. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for interacting with LLMs.
**Proxy Server:** The Proxy Server is a standalone service that acts as a gateway to multiple LLMs 1. It is typically used by Gen AI Enablement or ML Platform teams who want to provide a centralized service for accessing LLMs.

## **Deployment Options**

LiteLLM offers several deployment options to suit different needs:

| Deployment Option | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Quick Start | For calling 100+ LLMs with load balancing. |
| Deploy with Database | For using virtual keys and tracking spend. Requires a database URL and master key. |
| LiteLLM container \+ Redis | For load balancing across multiple LiteLLM containers. |
| LiteLLM Database container \+ PostgresDB \+ Redis | For using virtual keys, tracking spend, and load balancing across multiple containers. |

You can also build and run the LiteLLM Docker image yourself. Here's how:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   Bash
   `git clone https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm.git`

2. **Build the Docker image:**
   Bash
   `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.non_root -t litellm_test_image .`

3. **Run the Docker image:** Make sure config.yaml is present in the root directory. This is your LiteLLM proxy config file. 3

The choice of deployment option depends on your specific needs, such as whether you require virtual keys, spend tracking, or load balancing 10.

## **Logging and Observability with LiteLLM**

LiteLLM exposes predefined callbacks to send data to Lunary, Langfuse, Helicone, Promptlayer, Traceloop, and Slack 2. This allows developers to seamlessly integrate their LLM applications with existing monitoring and logging infrastructure.

Python

`from litellm import completion`

`# Set environment variables for logging tools`
`os.environ["HELICONE_API_KEY"] = "your-helicone-key"`
`os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = ""`
`os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = ""`
`os.environ["LUNARY_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "your-lunary-public-key"`
`os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-api-key"`

`# Set callbacks`
`litellm.success_callback = ["lunary", "langfuse", "helicone"]`

`# OpenAI call`
`completion(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "hello"}])`

## **Advanced Features of LiteLLM Proxy**

LiteLLM Proxy offers advanced features for managing API keys and controlling LLM usage:

* **Proxy Key Management:** You can connect the proxy with a Postgres database to create proxy keys, enabling features like budget and rate limits across multiple projects 3.
