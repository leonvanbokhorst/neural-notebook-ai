# Neural Notebook AI

A collection of proof-of-concepts (POCs) exploring AI agent architectures, LLM integration, and complex behavioral simulations.

## Proof of Concepts

### LiteLLM Integration (pocs/litellm)

A demonstration of using LiteLLM to interact with various LLM models, particularly focusing on Ollama integration. Features:

- Model-agnostic LLM interactions
- Usage tracking and statistics
- Streaming responses
- Configurable model parameters
- Callback handling for monitoring

### Weather Analysis Agent (pocs/pydantic_weather_agent)

An agentic weather service built using Pydantic.ai, demonstrating:

- Asynchronous weather data fetching
- Geocoding integration
- Structured data handling with Pydantic
- Tool-based agent architecture
- Streamlit-based visualization

## Development Standards

This project follows strict development standards including:

- PEP 8 style guide compliance
- Type hints (PEP 484)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Test coverage requirements
- Code review standards
- Error handling best practices

## Getting Started

Each POC contains its own README with specific setup instructions and requirements.
